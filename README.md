swroll
======

A dice roller for the tabletop RPG in a galaxy far far away.

This is not an official product.

I wrote this because I bought the tabletop RPG but the store(s) are out of
the custom dice needed to play the game.

At no point I assert anything on the game mechanics involved. My sole
intention is to help players enjoy the game.

Also any trademark usage is intended to be fair and really designate
the trademarked item.
